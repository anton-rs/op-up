#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This script starts a local devnet using Docker Compose. We have to use
# this more complicated Bash script rather than Compose's native orchestration
# tooling because we need to start each service in a specific order, and specify
# their configuration along the way. The order is:
#
# 1. Start L1.
# 2. Compile contracts.
# 3. Deploy the contracts to L1 if necessary.
# 4. Start L2, inserting the compiled contract artifacts into the genesis.
# 5. Get the genesis hashes and timestamps from L1/L2.
# 6. Generate the rollup driver's config using the genesis hashes and the
#    timestamps recovered in step 4 as well as the address of the OptimismPortal
#    contract deployed in step 3.
# 7. Start the rollup driver.
# 8. Start the L2 output submitter.
#
# The timestamps are critically important here, since the rollup driver will fill in
# empty blocks if the tip of L1 lags behind the current timestamp. This can lead to
# a perceived infinite loop. To get around this, we set the timestamp to the current
# time in this script.
#
# This script is safe to run multiple times. It stores state in `.devnet`, and
# contracts-bedrock/deployments/devnetL1.
# 
# Don't run this script directly, use the OP-Up CLI instead.
