# op-up

> OP-Up is a hive tool for testing OP-Stack-compatible software stacks.

This project was born out of the need to test out [Magi](https://github.com/a16z/magi), a rollup client built for the OP stack. Having an easy-to-use environment to spin up a local devnet is crucial for quick testing and experimentation, especially when there exist different implementations of each component in the stack.
